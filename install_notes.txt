Notes for Raspberry Pi Install

(1) gps support

sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps

edit "/etc/default/gpsd" to

START_DAEMON="true"
USBAUTO="true"
DEVICES="dev/ttyACM0"

(2) IC2 support

Just enable in the RPI preferences

(3) Qt

Currently need to install the precompiled binaries for Qt5.15 support, and the various build-essential bits

(4) Motors

Turn off motors at startup using the python script "motor_test.py" by editing /etc/rc.local

(5) 2.8" LCD support

Currently this is built in but there are drivers on the internet that might be needed.
